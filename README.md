# You Touched It Last

A scuffed work in progress gamemode for the game nanos world. Where each player will be assigned a team. One will be randomly picked, that's when a countdown will begin. The chosen player will have to throw some form of "object" at another player before the timer countdowns to 0. The last player who touched it dies. And then it goes through multiple rounds until 1 player remains.
